This blog will follow the progress of my GSoC 2017 project for SymPy. My primary goal is to implement group homomorphisms and set it up in such a way that certain finite presentation groups (implemented as an `FpGroup` class in SymPy) could be considered as isomorphic permutation groups. That would be good because SymPy already has many group-theoretic algorithms implemented for the latter. To get this to work, I will also need to implement rewriting systems for `FpGroup`s. You can see my [application]() and [proposal]() for details. I will update this post later with a revised timeline for the project.
