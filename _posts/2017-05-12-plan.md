title: The plan
---

This blog will follow the progress of my GSoC 2017 project for SymPy. My primary goal is to implement group homomorphisms and set it up in such a way that certain finite presentation groups (implemented as an `FpGroup` class in SymPy) could be considered as permutation groups via an isomorphism. That would be good because SymPy already has many group-theoretic algorithms implemented for perm groups. To get this to work, I will also need to implement rewriting systems for `FpGroup`s. You can see my [application](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC-2017-Application-Valeriia-Gladkova:-Group-Theory) for details.

This post is a revised timelime for the project. I am currently in the middle of a term at uni and I'm going to have exams at the end of it: that's 12-21 June (with 3 exam-free days in that period). For that reason I won't be fully productive until 21 June but I'll do my best (and certainly will catch up afterwards). As such, I think I should do a bit of coding before 30 May. I'll start with some functionality unrelated to homomorphisms, as explained in my application. My current plan until the end of the First Evaluation period (26-30 June) is as follows:

* **By 30 May:** Add a `.subgroup()` method and a `.parent` attribute to `FpGroup`s and `PermutationGroup`s. Probably make some improvements in the Reidemeister-Schreier elimination techniques. Submit a PR.

* **31 May - 11 June:** Implement better checks for infinite `FpGroup`s. That will include the `abelian_invariants` function somewhere in the rings module (I'll do it for integers unless there is an obvious way to make the same algorithm work for general rings) and a search for a finite cyclic subgroup (which might not terminate but it's better to give it a try since if a group is infinite, this might works but `coset_enumeration` is unlikely to terminate). Create a PR by the end of it if it's finished.

* **12-25 June** My exams start. I'll start writing the `GroupHomomorphism` class and its functions with the assumption that rewriting systems and other things I might need are already implemented (which I will actually do later on). I'll also start writing my evaluation at the end of this period.
