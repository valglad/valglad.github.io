Hello, I am Val Gladkova, a mathematician currently based at the University of Manchester, UK. My research broadly lies in the area of arithmetic combinatorics, although I also have an interest in combinatorics generally as well as in related fields such as cryptography, algorithms, and complexity theory.

This site is under (re)construction at the moment. It originally existed as my project website for Google Summer of Code 2017 in which I worked on developing the group theory module in [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html). You can find my posts from the time [here](http://valglad.github.io/gsoc.html).
